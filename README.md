# 2EyeBombing

EyeBombing is the first project that was given to us. It was about finding Faces in everyday objects and surroundings in our daily life, to improve our perception as creatives.

This phenomenon is called pareidolia. Basically, you find a meaning in an object when in reality there isn’t one.

Our minds are always thinking as a whole, hunting up for patterns, and often try to find them, even if they aren’t really there.

The concept itself showed me how the visual impact can be bigger sometimes, and most of the times we don’t realise that there are countless shapes, sizes and textures around an element which bring a different and altogether meaning.

Both me and Josh were definitely inspired by Jody Smith, after seeing loads of creative and different ways of content. He proves that it's not only about the colour or the size, it's about of finding the real true simplicity and perspective of how we see things.

We searched a wide variety of pictures in different perspectives. At the beginning it wasn't that easy to find faces in objects, but as we were always working to improve our skills things were eventually starting to appear everywhere.

The buildings were really easy to work with but on the other hand the lights, shadows and the skies were probably the most complicated.

I edited some photos to make them look more like a face and played around the concept to have a better background for the most suitable software for this kind of things (Adobe Photoshop).

To sum up, after many open discussions about the topic, I was able to gain a muchdeeper knowledge and it was surely a huge experience that I learn a lot from.

There were some good points, from introduction to the final implementation, for example how we structured the slides and made them simple for everyone understand it better. At the same time, it made us realise that we could do more eye contact and express ourselves more with real examples, real stories.

A key point is communication and I think we should improve it, by giving the audience more challenges, so they can stick better with the information along the slides. Planning questions is also important to summarise our ideas.

It would also be good to train our body language, to be more comfortable with people we’re talking to, so that we don’t look like we’re into some kind of pressure, and making everything run smoothly with a good posture as well.
